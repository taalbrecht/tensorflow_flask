# Deploy tensorflow models in flask

Demonstration of tensorflow model deployment as a REST service using flask. Note, this does not use tensorflow serving.

Developed and tested in python 3.

Start using `python3 api.py`

The tensorflow portion of the code is based on an idea in a blog post by [Nathan Brixius](https://nathanbrixius.wordpress.com/2016/05/23/a-simple-predictive-model-in-tensorflow/).
